Your job is to:
Analyze the patterns of existing test cases.
Generate 20 additional test cases.
Ensure test cases are relevant variations of existing ones â€” modify request parameters, use edge cases, or include valid/invalid values.
All the generated test cases should be methods that already exist in the sample json. Example if only "GET" and "POST" methods are present in the sample, all new cases also should only be "GET" and "POST".
Preserve the exact schema and structure of the existing JSON.
Append the new test cases to the existing testCases array without modifying or deleting any existing test cases.
Output the entire JSON file (old + new test cases) in valid JSON format only. Do not include explanation, markdown, or comments.
